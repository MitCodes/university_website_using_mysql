</p><br>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>In a vast populated country like India, the requirement of energy is never-ending, thus generating numerous opportunities for electrical engineers.</p>
<p>
Electrical engineering is one of the largest and most diverse technological and engineering disciplines in today’s world. Electrical engineering is the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of electrical and electronics equipments such as electric motors, navigation systems, medical devices, broadcast and communication systems, power generation systems, electrical distribution systems, electric grids etc., while keeping in mind the safety, quality, economic feasibility and sustainability of these products and systems.<br><br>

Based on the fundamentals of Physics and Mathematics, Electrical Engineering became a field of it’s own in the 19th century due to innovations such as the generator, motors, telephone, wireless communications and electronics. Since then, electrical engineering has sure come a long way. Not only has it been one of the major driving forces behind cutting edge technology in areas such as power engineering, computer engineering, communications and mobile technologies, it has also significantly impacted several other fields such as nanotechnology, biomedical engineering, neuroscience and biotechnology, to name a few. Electrical engineering students use science, engineering, technology and analytical reasoning, creative and critical thinking skills to solve problems and design, construct and maintain electrical and electronics products.<br><br>

Some sub disciplines of electrical engineering are: electronics, digital computers, power engineering, telecommunications, control systems, RF engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, and microelectronics. India is home to renowned universities for electrical engineering, both at the undergraduate and graduate level.
