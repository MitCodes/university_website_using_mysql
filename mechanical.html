      <h3>About this course</h3>
<p>Mechanical Engineering is the art and science of designing, development and control of systems and components such as fluid mechanics, material science, thermodynamics, kinematics, etc. Mechanical engineers use these core concepts paired with tools like computer-aided design (CAD), and product lifecycle management to design, analyze and manufacturing of equipments.<br><br>

Department of Mechanical Engineering - widely recognized as one among the best Mechanical engineering college in Punjab has established a trademark in entire region by producing a competent workforce in the past years. Our course curriculum equips students with the expert knowledge and skills demanded in the wide-ranging areas of this oldest yet promising engineering discipline. 
</p><br>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>According to US Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for mechanical engineers is projected to grow 17 percent from 2014 to 2024.</p>
<p>
Mechanical Engineering has been characterized, traditionally, by broad technical activities in the areas of product and machine design; manufacturing and production engineering; the design and installation of thermal-fluid and/or mechanical systems; and the design, analysis and development. Mechanical Engineering includes the science and art of formulation, design, development and control of systems and components involving thermodynamics, mechanics, fluid mechanics, mechanisms and the conversion of energy into useful work. The undergraduate program of study in Mechanical Engineering at Rockstar University, addresses both the quest to understand how things work and the desire to put this understanding to practical use. The student body is guided by faculty who merit national and international recognition, who are members of prestigious engineering societies and counted among the outstanding scholars in their profession.<br><br>

The faculty is committed to the advancement of the fundamental Engineering sciences encountered by Undergraduates in a curriculum that is heavy in “basics.” This is balanced by their demonstrated interest and active participation in practical developments as well. Thus, our graduates can function at the leading edge of engineering practice, tackling jobs that are far from dull or routine.
